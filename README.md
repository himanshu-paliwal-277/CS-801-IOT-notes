## ‚úÖ Definition

**The Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to a network of **physical objects (things)** that are embedded with **sensors, software, and other technologies** to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the **Internet**.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Characteristics of IoT

- **Connectivity**: Devices are connected to the internet for communication.
- **Automation & Control**: IoT enables automation by allowing devices to work without human intervention.
- **Integration**: Integrates various technologies like cloud computing, big data, AI, etc.
- **Sensing**: Sensors collect real-time data from the environment.
- **Scalability**: Can support a large number of connected devices.

## ‚úÖ Components of IoT

- **Things/Devices** ‚Äì Physical objects like sensors, actuators, and gadgets.
- **Gateway** ‚Äì Connects devices to the internet and manages protocols.
- **Network** ‚Äì Used to transmit data (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 5G, etc.).
- **Cloud** ‚Äì Stores and processes the data.
- **User Interface** ‚Äì Allows users to interact with the system (e.g., mobile app).
